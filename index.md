# 👋 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Eduard Burcea**, a cybersecurity analyst focused on building robust defences, understanding adversary behavior, and continuously leveling up through hands-on learning.

This site showcases my most relevant **projects**, **technical writeups**, and **core skills**—developed through lab environments, self-guided research, and industry-recognized certifications.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I specialize in blue team operations, with a strong foundation in IT systems, detection engineering, and threat analysis. My approach combines hands-on technical work with a deep understanding of attacker techniques—because **to defend well, you have to think like the adversary**.

🔍 I actively study red team tools and tactics to sharpen my ability to anticipate threats, craft detection logic, and improve response capabilities. I'm active on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **CyberDefenders**, and **BlueTeamLabs**, and currently advancing my skills in **Malware Analysis** and **Ethical Hacking** through **TCM Academy**.
