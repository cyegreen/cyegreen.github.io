# 👋 Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I'm **Eduard Burcea**, an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** dedicated to building robust defenses and proactively mitigating cyber threats.

This portfolio showcases my hands-on **projects**, detailed **writeups**, and the diverse **skills** I've cultivated through industry-recognised courses and certifications, practical experience, blue team simulations, and continuous learning in the realm of cybersecurity.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm driven by a passion for technology and cybersecurity, with a particular focus on becoming a highly effective **Blue Teamer**. My goal is to leverage technical expertise, deep understanding of IT systmes, security frameworks, tools, adversarial tactics, methodologies to strengthen security posture of organisations. And keeping up with new technologies that reshape AI, Quantum and blockchain that reshape the indutsry. 

💡 My philosophy is that **effective defense requires an attacker's mindset and hands-on skills**. I actively explore red team tools and techniques to enhance my ability to anticipate threats, refine detection strategies, and improve incident response capabilities. I am active on TryHackMe, CyberDefenders and Blueteamlabs, Also an student of TCM Academy where I explore advance topics like Malware Analysis and Ethical Hacking.

🛠️ My learning environment includes a dedicated **home lab** where I simulate real-world scenarios. I experiment with log management (forwarding, aggregation), SIEM dashboard creation, Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) configuration, and malware analysis workflows to gain practical insights.
